# 20-isAnagram

## Background
Given two strings, write a function to determine if there is a word anagram relationship between the two inputs.

<h4>An anagram is a word made by transposing the letters of another word. In other words, an anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word</h4>

## Task
Write out a function, (`isAnagram(s,t)`). For input, you will be given a string referenced as s and a string referenced as t. For output, you will return a boolean.
Return true if t is an anagram of s. Otherwise, return the false value.

## Examples
```
isAnagram("door", "doorman") -----> false
isAnagram("boy", "bought") -----> false
isAnagram("read", "red") -----> false
isAnagram("battle", "tablet") -----> true
isAnagram("silent", "listen") -----> true
```
